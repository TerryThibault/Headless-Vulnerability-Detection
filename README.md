# Headless-Vulnerability-Detection

## Usage

* `$ cd Headless-Vulnerability-Detection/`
* `$ npm i puppeteer`
* `$ node main.js [target url]`

## To do

### Absolutely core functionality
- [x] Crawl entire website and save the URLs that are in scope
- [x] Get all forms on webpage
- [x] Identify all of the entry points on each of the forms on each of the webpages
- [ ] Allow user to supply their own cookies
- [ ] Identify where all of entry points are displayed on the website
- [ ] Correlate the entry points to the display of the text. 
- [ ] Inject the XSS payload into the entry points
- [ ] Crawl to the page that each entry point ends on
- [ ] If alert, log it in the DB
- [ ] Allow the user to set cookies 

### Things to make the product more appealing
- [ ] Save everything to a local db
- [ ] Build a large database of common (and uncommon) XSS payloads
- [ ] Build out an admin webpage to make pointing the tool at different websites and logging the vulnerable entry points
- [ ] Test other vulnerabilities. like SQL injection. 
- [ ] Build an auto-install thing, since node can be kind of annoying.


## Known issues
This project is driven by Google Chrome's Puppeteer Team. There is a bug in Puppeteer where if a page is navigated to and then immediately redirected (in cases where the user should log in to view that specific page this can happen), the previous page's context is destroyed. This will break the crawler part of Puppeteer. This tool can have the effects of that mitigated by allowing for a user to set cookies.
