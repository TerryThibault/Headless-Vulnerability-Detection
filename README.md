# Headless-Vulnerability-Detection

## To do

### Absolutely core functionality
* [] Crawl entire website and save the URLs to a local database (maybe a PostgreSQL DB)
* [] Identify all of the entry points on each of the webpages
* [] Identify where all of entry points are displayed on the website
* [] Correlate the entry points to the display of the text. 
* [] Inject the XSS payload into the entry points
* [] Crawl to the page that each entry point ends on
* [] If alert, log it in the DB

### Things to make the product more appealing
* [] Build a large database of common (and uncommon) XSS payloads
* [] Build out an admin webpage to make pointing the tool at different websites and logging the vulnerable entry points
* [] Test other vulnerabilities. like SQL injection. 
* [] Build an auto-install thing, since node can be kind of annoying.
